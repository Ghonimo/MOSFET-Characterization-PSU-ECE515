# MOSFET-Characterization-PSU-ECE515

## Description
This project offers an in-depth analysis of n-channel MOSFET characteristics, focusing on the 2N7000 model. It was conducted for the ECE 515: Fundamentals of Semiconductor Devices course at Portland State University. Utilizing the B1500 Device Analyzer within the ICDT Research Lab, we explored the current-voltage relationships to understand MOSFET behavior comprehensively.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghonimo/MOSFET-Characterization-PSU-ECE515.git
```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
4. The data and MATLAB scripts are organized into folders. No additional setup is required.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis, perform the following:
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `MATLAB Code` directory.
2. Run the scripts in the following order:
- `Output_Characteristics.m` for output characteristics analysis.
- `Transfer_Characteristics.m` for transfer characteristics analysis.
- `Subthreshold_Region_Analysis.m` for subthreshold region exploration.
3. The scripts will automatically import data from the `Collected Data` folder and generate relevant plots and results.
4. Refer to the `Report_Appendix_With_MATLAB_Code.pdf` for detailed explanations of each script and its output.

## Results
The project successfully extracted key parameters of the MOSFET, including threshold voltage and subthreshold slope. These findings are crucial for understanding the device's operation and optimizing semiconductor device designs.
